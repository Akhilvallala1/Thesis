Decontamination of Dataset: camel-ai/physics

This repository contains the implementation of dataset decontamination applied to the camel-ai/physics dataset. The decontamination process ensures that the training dataset is free from overlapping or contaminated samples from evaluation datasets, particularly for use in fine-tuning language models.

This code is based on the Decontamination Module from the Cosmopedia repository by Hugging Face.

Overview:

Original Dataset: camel-ai/physics
Purpose: Physics-related question-answering dataset with:
Questions in message_1 column
Answers in message_2 column
Size: ~20k rows
Decontamination Goal: Remove potential overlaps with evaluation datasets to ensure clean, unbiased training data.
Evaluation Dataset for Decontamination: lighteval/mmlu (subset: college_physics).


Key Features:

Decontamination Process:
Tokenizes the training and evaluation datasets.
Identifies overlapping n-grams between training and evaluation datasets.
Filters out contaminated samples from the training dataset based on overlap thresholds.
Output:
A contamination report uploaded to Hugging Face Hub.
A clean, decontaminated training dataset, ready for fine-tuning models.
